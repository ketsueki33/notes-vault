NextJS uses a "file-based" router system.
- Folders are  used to define routes.
- Files are used to create UI for that route segment.

### Simple Routes
**Let's understand this with an example**
We have a Navbar component that we want to reuse across different pages.
```jsx
import Link from "next/link";
import styles from "./navbar.module.css";

const Navbar = () => {
    return (
        <header>
            <nav className={styles.nav}>
                <p>Next.js</p>
                <ul className={styles.links}>
                    <Link href="/">
                        <li>Homeüè† </li>
                    </Link>
                    <Link href="/about">
                        <li>About üê∂ </li>
                    </Link>
                    <Link href="/contact">
                        <li>Contact ‚òéÔ∏è</li>
                    </Link>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </ header>
    );
};
export default Navbar;
```

And then, we include the `Navbar` component in our `Layout.tsx` file. 
```tsx 
import Navbar from "@/components/Navbar";
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: "Create Next App",
    description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body className={inter.className}>
                <Navbar />
                {children}
            </body>
        </html>
    );
}
```
`Navbar` will now appear in all of our pages.

**Now, onto the routing**
To create a route for the "About" section, we need to create an `about` folder inside the `app` directory. Make sure the folder name is lowercase as this is the name that will appear as the route.

A page is UI that is unique to a route. You can define a page by default exporting a component from a `page.tsx` file. Create the `page.tsx` file which will contain the UI of About section:
```tsx
export default function About() {
    return (
        <main>
            <h1>About</h1>
        </main>
    );
}
```
Going to `/about` will now show this content.

### Nested Routes
Nested routes are as simple as nesting one folder inside another. 

To create a route `projects/list`
- first create a `projects` folder
- then a `list` folder
- inside that, create a `pages.tsx`
```tsx
import Link from "next/link";

export default function ProjectLists() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Project List</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <Link href="/projects/black-flag">Project Black Flag</Link>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <Link href="/projects/warrior-within">Project 
                    Warrior Within</Link>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <Link href="/projects/wild-hunt">Project Wild Hunt</Link>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Dynamic Routes
Dynamic routes allow for more flexibility. The route will be determined by the content of the page. ( eg. a page showing book details will have the book name as the route )

To create a dynamic route, we will have to ==wrap the folder's name in square brackets.==
NextJS provides us a way to access what value has been passed to `page.tsx` through the `params` prop . The value is in the `params` object with key being the folder name within square brackets.

Eg) Creating a project details page.
- within the `projects` folder, create a `[name]` folder
- create a `pages.tsx` file.
```tsx
interface Props {
    params: {
        name: string;
    };
}

export default function ProjectDetails({ params }: Props) {
    return (
        <main>
            <h1>{params.name}</h1>
        </main>
    );
}
```
The project name will be read from the route and displayed.

 ###### [Catch-all segments](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments)

Dynamic Segments can be extended to **catch-all** subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets `[...folderName]`.

For example, `app/shop/[...slug]/page.js` will match `/shop/clothes`, but also `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`, and so on.

|Route|Example URL|`params`|
|---|---|---|
|`app/shop/[...slug]/page.js`|`/shop/a`|`{ slug: ['a'] }`|
|`app/shop/[...slug]/page.js`|`/shop/a/b`|`{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }`|
|`app/shop/[...slug]/page.js`|`/shop/a/b/c`|`{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }`|

 ###### [Optional Catch-all segments](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments)

Catch-all Segments can be made **optional** by including the parameter in double square brackets: `[[...folderName]]`.

For example, `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` will **also** match `/shop`, in addition to `/shop/clothes`, `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`.

The difference between **catch-all** and **optional catch-all** segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (`/shop` in the example above).

| Route                          | Example URL   | `params`                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` | `/shop`       | `{}`                        |
| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` | `/shop/a`     | `{ slug: ['a'] }`           |
| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` | `/shop/a/b`   | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }`      |
| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |
### Route Groups
As our app grows, many different routes will be there. And for every route, we will be creating a separate folder within the `app` folder. This can clutter our folder view.

To better organize our routes, we can group routes together.

We can create Route Groups by enclosing the folder name in parentheses.
eg) `(folder-name)`

These folders will not affect the routing or the links of our application.
